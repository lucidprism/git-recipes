  <img src="/home/lucid/repos/git-recipes/links-images/grill-pizza.png" alt="Grilled pizza" width="400">

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <h4>Pizza Dough:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup warm water (110°F/45°C)</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
    <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Garlic Oil:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Pizza Toppings:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
    <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise again until doubled, about 1 more hour.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine ½ cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
    <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
    <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust is lightly browned, turn it over using two spatulas.</li>
    <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust. Top with ½ of each: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.</li>
    <li>Close lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool slightly. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
